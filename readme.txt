Polylang adds multilingual content management support to WordPress.

== Description ==

= Features  =

Polylang allows you to create a bilingual or multilingual WordPress site. You write posts, pages and create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them. The translation of a post, whether it is in the default language or not, is optional. The translation has to be done by the site editor as Polylang does not integrate any automatic or professional translation service.

* You can use as many languages as you want. RTL language scripts are supported. WordPress languages files are automatically downloaded and updated.
* You can translate posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, menus, widgets... Custom post types, custom taxonomies, sticky posts and post formats, RSS feeds and all default WordPress widgets are supported.
* The language is either set by the content or by the language code in url (either directory or subdomain), or you can use one different domain per language
* Categories, post tags as well as some other metas are automatically copied when adding a new post or page translation
* A customizable language switcher is provided as a widget or in the nav menu
* The admin interface is of course multilingual too and each user can set the WordPress admin language in its profile

= Do you like Polylang? =

Don't hesitate to [give your feedback](http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/polylang#postform). It will help making the plugin better. Other [contributions](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/contribute/) (such as new translations or helping other users on the support forum) are welcome !

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you are using WordPress 3.1 or later and that your server is running PHP5 (if you are using WordPress 3.2 or newer, it does !)
1. If you tried other multilingual plugins, deactivate them before activating Polylang, otherwise, you may get unexpected results !
1. Download the plugin
1. Extract all the files.
1. Upload everything (keeping the directory structure) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the languages settings page and create the languages you need
1. Add the 'language switcher' widget to let your visitors switch the language.
1. Take care that your theme must come with the corresponding .mo files (Polylang downloads them for themes bundled with WordPress). If your theme is not internationalized yet, please refer to the [codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#I18n_for_theme_and_plugin_developers) or ask the theme author to internationalize it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where to find help ? =

* Read the [documentation](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/). It includes [guidelines to start working with Polylang](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/setting-up-a-wordpress-multilingual-site-with-polylang/), a [FAQ](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/frequently-asked-questions/) and the [documentation for programmers](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/documentation-for-developers/).
* Search the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang). I know that searching in the WordPress forum is not very convenient, but please give it a try. You can use generic search engines such as Google too as the WordPress forum SEO is very good. You will most probably find your answer here.
* If you still have a problem, open a new thread in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang).
