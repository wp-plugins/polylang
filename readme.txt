Polylang adds multilingual content management support to WordPress.

== Description ==

= Features  =

Polylang allows you to create a bilingual or multilingual WordPress site. You write posts, pages and create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them. The translation is optional. The plugin does not integrate automatic or professional translation.

* You can have as many languages as you want. RTL languages are supported. WordPress languages files are automatically downloaded and updated.
* You can translate posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, menus, widgets... Custom post types, custom taxonomies, sticky posts and post formats, RSS feeds and all default WordPress widgets are supported.
* Categories, post tags as well as some other metas are automatically copied when adding a new post or page translation
* Support for multisite, pretty permalinks and static page used as front page
* A customizable language switcher is provided as a widget or in the nav menu
* The admin interface is of course multilingual too and each user can set the WordPress admin language in its profile

= Feedback or ideas =

Don't hesitate to [give your feedback](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang). It will help making the plugin better. Don't hesitate to rate the plugin too.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you are using WordPress 3.1 or later and that your server is running PHP5 (if you are using WordPress 3.2 or newer, it does !)
1. If you tried other multilingual plugins, deactivate them before activating Polylang, otherwise, you may get unexpected results !
1. Download the plugin
1. Extract all the files.
1. Upload everything (keeping the directory structure) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the languages settings page and create the languages you need
1. Add the 'language switcher' widget to let your visitors switch the language.
1. Take care that your theme must come with the corresponding .mo files (Polylang downloads them for Twenty Ten and Twenty Eleven). If your theme is not internationalized yet, please refer to the [codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#I18n_for_theme_and_plugin_developers) or ask the theme author to internationalize it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where to find help ? =

* Read the [documentation](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/). It includes [guidelines to start working with Polylang](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/setting-up-a-wordpress-multilingual-site-with-polylang/), a [FAQ](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/frequently-asked-questions/) and the [documentation for programmers](http://polylang.wordpress.com/documentation/documentation-for-developers/).
* Search the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang). I know that searching in the WordPress forum is not very convenient, but please give it a try. You can use generic search engines such as Google too as the WordPress forum SEO is very good. You will most probably find your answer here.
* If you still have a problem, open a new thread in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang).

== Contribute ==

If you wonder how you can help Polylang, here are some ideas. As you will read, there is no need to be a PHP developper!

= Help other users of Polylang =

The [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang) is here so that users of the plugin can get help when they need it. However, I will not always be available to answer questions. You don't need to be a developer to help out. Very often similar questions have been answered in the past.

= Report bugs =

Don't hesitate to report bugs on the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/polylang).

= Test new versions =

You can subscribe to the [blog](http://polylang.wordpress.com/) that I use to announce development versions and then, test the new versions and report bugs before the final release. It helps a lot!

= Translate the admin interface =

Polylang is already available in 25 languages. It's very easy to add a new one! Download [poedit](http://www.poedit.net/download.php) (available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux). Rename the file polylang.pot found in the polylang/languages directory into something like polylang-your_locale.po. Open the file with poedit and start translating (keeping strange codes such as %s, %1$s as is). Once done, just save and you will get two files polylang-your_locale.po and polylang-your_locale.mo that you can send to the author. The translation will be included with the next release and will be covered by the same license as Polylang (GPLv2 or later).

= Communicate =

If you like Polylang, you can spread the word... Rating the plugin is very easy, you can write some words about the plugin, make a link to the plugin page...

= What else ? =

Every suggestions are welcome.
